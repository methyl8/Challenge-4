# Challenge-4-Javascript-Quiz

Javascript quiz
---
## Description
Display a small timed Javascript quiz.  Questions and answers are generated from an array, and elements generated dynamically.  Result of the previous answer is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Score is the time remaining when all questions have been answered or time expires.  Incorrect answers result in a time and score penalty of 10 seconds.  Minimum score is 0 (so answering all questions wrong in 60 seconds will not result in a negative score).  
Current score will be tracked in local storage item "scores".  All previous scores can be viewed on High Scores screen, and cleared with "reset Scores" button.
